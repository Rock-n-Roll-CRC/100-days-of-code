# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today, I have learnt some theory about the "Number" object's methods and numeric separators. As for the practical part, I have solved some not so challenging katas on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) and additionally worked on my [Frontend Mentor coding challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/contact-form--G-hYlqKJj/hub). ‚úÖ

**Thoughts** I feel motivated, ready to code and learn new things. Let's see for how long it will stay that way. üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
